Thank you for stopping by. This is a brief self-introduction page about me, Feng Xu. Here you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/AlisterFengXu) (a place where you can find my *fork* codes of Praat, R, and Python), my email address (feel free to contact me with anything you want to share with me), and a secret place of my Twitter and Weibo.

I am currently a Phd candidate in at [Macquarie University Department of Linguistics](https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/our-faculties/medicine-and-health-sciences/departments-and-centres/department-of-linguistics), also a member of [Child Language Lab](https://www.mq.edu.au/about/about-the-university/our-faculties/medicine-and-health-sciences/departments-and-centres/department-of-linguistics/our-research/child-language-acquisition/child-language-lab). My research centers on **suprasegmental features of speech**, especially on the following topics:

- Acoustic features of tone and intonation (pitch, duration, and amplitude)
- Roles of tone and intonation in expressing linguistic and paralinguistic meanings
- The interaction of tone and intonation in tonal languages

Recently, I have a special interest in **tonal and/or intonational production and perception by people with hearing loss and cochlear implants**. Additionally, I am also interested in **data science using `R` and `Python`**, especially data visualization.
